I started this project as a way to build something using Test-driven development (TDD). It sort of ballooned into a full-blown application with user accounts, statistics for tracking clicks, and a way to create URLs at any point when logged into the app. It has become my playground to try out new features released for the (https://laravel.com)[Laravel] framework as well as any front-end JavaScript framework I want to get to know.
